\arguments{
\item{schoolthr}{is a function of size and mean volume backscattering strength (S_V) defining the threshold level below the 90-percentile of the school using the initial above-noise-threshold. Can also be is a vector of values, where one segmentation file is written for each value of 'schoolthr'.}
