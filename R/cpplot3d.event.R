#' Interactive scatterplot of the (3 dimensional) points either plotted by color and size or number of points in each voxel corresponding to the value of the points.
#'
#' @param cpplot3d_type  is "c" for cplot3d.event() and "p" for pplot3d.event().

#' @param t  is either a vector of the numbers of the pings to be returned, as listed from 1 to the number of pings in the event, or a vector of time points given as strings "yyyymmddHHMMSS.FFF" or "HHMMSS.FFF" from which the range of the time points to be read is extracted. If t=="all", all files are read and if t=="none" an empty list is returned.
#' @param turns  is the number of pings read and plotted in each turn, useful if many time points are to be plotted and memory is an issue (such as >100 time steps for MS70).
#' @param cruise  is either the idenfication number of the cruise, given as specified by the IMR (yyyynnn), or the path to the directory containing the event to be read.
#' @param TVG  is FALSE if no Time Varied Gain compensation is to be performed on the acoustic data.
#' @param dir.data  is the path to the directory in which the projects are stored, defaulted by the variable Acoustics_datasets_directory().
#' @param Paout  is TRUE if pressure data are to be returned in Pascal.
#' @param exact  is TRUE if the volumes should be calculated by the slower procedure incorporating the edges of the voxels. If FALSE (default) use the fast functions which only account for changes in the thickness of the voxels.
#' @param bgns  indicates wheter the estimated background noise should be subtracted, resulting in some negative sv-values. If FALSE the background noise estimates are attemptedly located in the event directory or the noise estimate directory of the cruise. If string, it should be the path to the file holding the background noise estimates. If the length of 'bgns' is longer than 1, the background noise estmate taken as the simple mean for all beams, regardless of the periodic noise is used.
#' @param pdns  indicates wheter the estimated periodic noise should be subtracted. If FALSE the periodic noise estimates are attemptedly located in the event directory or the noise estimate directory of the cruise. If string, it should be the path to the file holding the periodic noise estimates.
#' @param nrns  indicates wheter the estimated near range (close range) noise should be subtracted. If FALSE the near range noise estimates are attemptedly located in the event directory or the noise estimate directory of the cruise.
#' @param hins  indicates wheter the estimated high intensity noise should be subtracted. If FALSE the high intensity noise estimates are attemptedly located in the event directory or the noise estimate directory of the cruise.
#' @param kern  is the standard deviation in units of the number of voxels used in a Gaussian kernel smoother along the beams (no smoothing if kern==0 or length(kern)==0, which is the default).
#' @param segpar  is a list of elements named "bwGp", "lsth"/"rlst", "usth"/"rust", or "sgth"/"sgt0" specifying the parameters of the segmentation data to read.
#' @param pamkpar  is a list of parameters ('krange', 'criterion', 'alpha' and 'mindist') used pamk() when clustering the segmented voxels 'sgsc'. The voxels 'sgsc' are also ordered so that the voxels belonging to the largest cluster lead and the second to largest cluster follows. A suggested set of parameters are pamkpar=list(krange=1:4,criterion="asw",alpha=0.05,N=1e2,mindist=100).
#' @param nsind  is a vector of indexes along the beams, as input to ind.expand(), used to select the subset over which the estimation of the phase of the periodic noise is done. If given as a single numeric, the outermost 'nsind' voxels are used in each beam.
#' @param hins_add  is the number of voxels that should be discarded on both sides of high intensity noise voxels voxels along beams, used for accounting for possible high values that are related to the high intensity noise but not classified as such voxels.
#' @param pdns_scale  is used in get.pdns_phase.event() to scale the noise in order to allow the optimization to work.
#' @param TOV  is the time offset of the vessel information, discovered by Holmin and Korneliussen in 2013. The default is found in "/Applications/echoIBM/Documentation/Error in yaw MS70/Error in yaw MS70.R".
#' @param breaks  has two possible inputs: (1) the number of breaks of the scale on which the data 'z' are arranged, equally spaced between min(z) and max(z) (or logarithmically equaly spaced when log=TRUE). (2) a vector of values for the breaks given in dB values (volume backscattering strength Sv), typically -82:-30 for EK60.
#' @param col  is either the color vector if length(col)>1, or the color function to generate the colors from. Currently the color function name must be one of "rainbow", "grey", "heat.colors", "terrain.colors", "topo.colors" and "cm.colors", but other color functions may be inplemented in the future. Set color.bar=NULL to supress plotting the color bar.
#' @param colpar  is a list of parameters used in colscale().
#' @param size  is the size vector of the points (see plot3d()), or a function of the number of breaks, such as the functions returned by cplot3d.size(), or a list of inputs to cplot3d.size().
#' @param clamp  is a vector of two elements defining the start and end value along the range of the data, outside which the colors plotted are the colors representing the lowest bin and the highest bin, (depending on the value of 'flip' and/or 'start' and 'end' specified in 'colpar'). If given in [0,1] 'clamp' refers to the fractions along the range of the data, and to dB values if not.
#' @param shrink  is TRUE if discarded points due to the value of 'white' are to be excluded from the plott, so that the bounding box is shrinked to the range of visible points.
#' @param null.value  is is the value to set non-postitive values to in the case of logarithmic plotting. The default is the only non-numeric value allowed, and uses the smallest positive value of the data.
#' @param white  is an integer value representing the number of the lower breaks for which points should not be plotted (corresponding to white points). Can be given as a dB value below which breaks are plotted as white.
#' @param log  is TRUE if log transformed data are to be plotted. If so, all values must be positive.
#' @param color.bar  is a string of three characters, where the first is one of "x", "y", "z", and denotes along which dimension the color bar should be parallel, the second and third characters are either "-" or "+", and denotes along which of the four edges parallel to the axis given by the first charater, the color bar should be put (where the axes are ranged "x", "y", "z"). color.bar="x-+" puts the color bar on the top south edge, if the x-axis is defined east, the y-axis north and the z-axis vertical. If 'color.bar' is FALSE, NULL or "", plotting of the color bar is suppressed.
#' @param color.bar.lwd  is the line width of the color bar (thickness).
#' @param color.bar.adj  is a vector of adjustment values for the color bar (in the x, y, and z direction), where the values are given as fractions of the size of the corresponding dimensions. If given as a single numeric, 'color.bar.adj' is interpreted as the adjustment in the lowest available dimension (for example in the y direciton if color.bar="x--").
#' @param color.bar.tadj  is similar to 'color.bar.adj', but for the labels of the tickmarks on the color bar.
#' @param color.bar.noWhite  is FALSE to include all values which are not plotted due to 'white' in the color bar.
#' @param color.bar.nticks  is the desired number of ticks on the color bar, used in pretty().
#' @param color.bar.tickw  is the thickness of the tick marks on the color bar, as a fraction of the plotting frame.
#' @param color.bar.tickcol  is the color of the tich marks.
#' @param db  is FALSE if the color bar should display linear (not desibel) values.
#' @param voxels.out  is TRUE if the position of all voxels plotted should be included in the output.
#' @param N  is the approximate number of points plotted.
#' @param acca  is the acoustic scattering cross sectional area (assuming omnidirectional targets). Overriding 'N' if given.
#' @param fun  is the name of the funciton used for obtaining the number of points in each voxel by "rounding off" to integers. The string given in 'fun' must be the name of a function taking 'x' as the input, such as "floor", "round", "ceiling" and "mod", where the last function is defined in sv2pos() and draws between floor(x) and ceiling(x) with probability P(ceiling(x))=x\%\%1. Also, there is the option of adding a numeric to "mod", such as "mod3" or "mod4.2", to indicate that all voxels with number of points below the given numeric, are set to zero.
#' @param allert  is the limit of the number of points inducing a warning asking the user to continue. Default is NULL, indicating no check for the number of points to be generated.
#' @param nlim  is a vector of limits for the number of points, dividing the voxels into classes in which the number of points are reduced by the values specified in 'fact'. If nlim==NULL, the default values are set in pplot3d.set.default.nlim() depending on whether the acoustical instrument is a sonar (nlim = 30^(1:5)) or an echosounder (nlim = 50^(1:4)) (for echosounders the bottom echo may require larger values of 'nlim'). Note that 0 is added to the head of 'nlim', representing the unchnaged class of points which should not be changed in number. Thus, if nlim=100, the voxels containing less than 100 points are assigned to the first level, and voxels with 100 points or more are assigned to the second level. The values nlim=Inf and nlim=0 imply only one class, which is also achieved by setting 'cols' to only one color.
#' @param fact  is either NULL, indicating that fact=1/sqrt(nlim), or the factor by which to scale the number of points in voxels exceeding the value of 'nlim'. If 'fact' has length shorter than 'nlim', the first value is used as a base in fact = fact[1]^(1:length(nlim)). As for 'nlim', 'fact' is added 1 to the head, indicating no scaling of the number of points in the voxels in the first level. 'fact' can also be given as a function, in which case the function recreating the default factors is function(x) x^(-1/2), whereas function(x) x^(-2/3) would reduce the number of points plotted.
#' @param cols  is a vector specifying the colors of the points in the different levels. Differing from 'nlim' and 'fact', the color vector must include also the basic class of voxels starting from one point in each voxel. If the length of 'cols' is shorter than 'nlim' or 'fact', these are cropped to the length of 'cols' after 0 is added to 'nlim' and 1 is added to 'fact'. Thus, specifying cols=2 sets all points to red, and applies no classes for the voxels.
#' @param stretch  is used to stretch the voxels of the ME70 multibeam echosounder in the direction of motion, so that space in between voxels is smoothed out. If given as a two element vector, the first element sets the stretching factor applied at the depth given by the second element. This results in attemptedly constant stretching for all depths.
#' @param possample  is used to select a sample of the regenerated points to plot, used when all points are at the same level og TS, and the number of points should be reduced in the plot but not in the data.
#' @param esnm  is the name of the acoustical instrument, given as a four character string. See sonR_implemented() for the implemented systems. May be given in 'data', and in lower case.
#' @param var  is a string specifying the variable to plot. Currently supported are "vbsc", for volume backscattering data, "sgsc"/"sgs0"/"sgsE"/"sgsi"/"sgsI", for (thresholded) segmentation data, "pr0s" or "psis" for unhtresholded not-school probability data, and "tlns" for pure estimated noise. Segmentation data can be subtracted or added to the data by by adding "+" or "-" to a second element of var, where this is a segmentation variable name such as "-sgbt", which implies subtracting bottom segmentation mask. See cpplot3d.extract_var(). 
#' @param ind  is a list of indexes, as typed into the [] of an array, where 0 and NULL denotes all indexes.
#' @param range  is a list of elements with names matching names of 'data', specifying the range of the corresponding elements.
#' @param subset  is a numeric or logical vector/expression indicating elements or rows to keep. Missing values are taken as false, and subset=0 or subset=NULL indicates no subsetting.
#' @param ideal  is TRUE to represent the simple case where the speed of sound 'data$asps' is invariant of depth.
#' @param seabed  is the depth of the seabed, at which the beams are reflected when calculating the midpoints of voxels.
#' @param rot  see soundbeam.TSD().
#' @param compensation  is a vector of string giving which rotation values that are compensated for in the sonar. Only c("pitch","roll") is available for the current version. Used in soundbeam.TSD.
#' @param plot  is FALSE to prevent plotting.

#' @param add  is TRUE if points are to be added to an existing plot.
#' @param beamstypes  is a vector of strings "rect" and "circ", or a vector integers 1 and 2 specifying whether to plot rectangular og circular beams. If beamstypes==1, the rectangular beams are plotted if both present, and the once present are plotted if only rectangular or only circular beams are present.
#' @param bottom  has five possible values: (a) If bottom=="new", a new set of segmentation data is generated, where the bottom is detected due to the default specifications used in echoIBM.segment.event() (sgth=0.2, misM=1e-3, bwGp=2, turns=100). Note that no plot is generated when bottom=="new". (b) If 'bottom' is FALSE or 0, no bottom is plotted or removed (default). (c) If 'bottom' is TRUE or 1, the segmentation mask holding the bottom (sgbt) is removed from the data, and a surface generated by cpplot3d.bottom.TSD() based on points generated by pplot3d.TSD() is plotted. (d) If bottom==2, the segmentation mask holding the bottom, and all voxels below these voxels, are removed from the data, and the surface plotted as in (c). (e) If 'bottom' is negative, the same action is taken as for positive values, but the bottom surface is not plotted (only removing the bottom segmentation mask, and everything below in the case that bottom=-2).
#' @param bottom.res  is the resolution in meters of the grid to which the bottom is estimated. Higher values causes smoother bottom, but more spiky edges. Lower values causes more noise and a risk of missing fields in the bottom surface.
#' @param bottom.col  is the function to use for coloring the bottom surface, generated by colscale(). Possibel values are "rainbow", "grey", "heat.colors", "terrain.colors", "topo.colors", "cm.colors", and "combined". Use ... to set parameters of the color function, such as 'start' and 'end'. See colscale() for explaination of parameters of the color functions.
#' @param bottom.N  is the number of points generated by pplot3d.TSD() upon which the generated bottom surface is calculated by interpolation. High values may lead to more accurate bottom surface, but will also be time demanding.
#' @param bottom.seg  is a list of segmentation parameters used when segmenting out the bottom or selecting previously generated segmentation masks. Do not change these settings unless the preformance of the segmentation method is unsatisfactory for the specific data set. Specifically, 'sgth' denotes that the default segmentation threshold is raised to the power 'sgth' in order to allow for large segmentation mask covering all points of the bottom; 'misM' is the input mean volume backscatterinf coefficient specifying the levels of the bottom; 'bwGp' is the bandwidth in meters of the Gaussian kernel used in echoIBM.segment.event(); and 'turns' is the number of pings used in each turn of the segmentation method, where higher values leads to fewer edge effects in the bottom surface.
#' @param adds  is an optional list of variables overriding the variables in 'data'.
#' @param xlim  the x limits (x1, x2) of the plot. Can only be used to increase the plotting frame. Note that x1 > x2 is allowed and leads to a ‘reversed axis’. If one of xlim, ylim or zlim is NA, all the data and the entire sonar frame are included in the plot.
#' @param ylim  the y limits (y1, y2) of the plot. Can only be used to increase the plotting frame. Note that x1 > x2 is allowed and leads to a ‘reversed axis’. If one of xlim, ylim or zlim is NA, all the data and the entire sonar frame are included in the plot.
#' @param zlim  the z limits (z1, z2) of the plot. Can only be used to increase the plotting frame. Note that x1 > x2 is allowed and leads to a ‘reversed axis’. If one of xlim, ylim or zlim is NA, all the data and the entire sonar frame are included in the plot.

	# Update: 2010-02-19 - Changed to supporting the subset list 'subset', used in extract.
	# Update: 2010-03-02 - Added support for specifying the ranges of "x", "y" and "z" ('range').
	# Update: 2010-04-17 - Altered to letting the first and the last break move to infinity.
	# Update: 2011-01-06 - Added the option 'null.value'.
	# Update: 2011-01-17 - Added the option 'shrink'.
	# Update: 2011-01-17 - Simplified using the new cplot3d.TSD(), that was expanded to support multiple time steps in the input 'data'.
	# Update: 2011-10-02 - Changed to add axes and bounding box at the end of the function, and added the option 'beams' for use when plotting sonar grid og the ME70 echosounder. Also added plotting of sonar grid at the end of the funciton, using add.sonar.grid().
	# Update: 2012-03-15 - Added the options 'nticks' and 'edge' for customizing axes individually.
	# Update: 2012-06-28 - Added support for plotting 'pr0s', 'sgsc' and 'sgs0', specified by 'type'.
	# Update: 2012-11-15 - Added 'color.bar.noWhite'.
	# Update: 2013-01-05 - Added the option type="tlns".
	# Update: 2013-08-19 - Restructured function and categorized inputs.
	# Update: 2013-10-07 - Added the option of var[1]="-vbsc" indicating disabeling plotting of the acoustic data.
	# Update: 2013-10-07 - Merged cplot3d.event() and pplot3d.event().
	# Update: 2014-04-03 - Added 'schoolnumt'.
	# Update: 2014-05-27 - Updated to include 'indt'.
	# Last: 2015-03-10 - Added 'light' for setting the angle of the rgl light source (default is no light source).
