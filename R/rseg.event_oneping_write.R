#'
#' @param d  is the list of data including segmentation and acoustic data.
#' @param thisseg  is the segmentatino mask.
#' @param thist_seq  is the time step index. One of 1:t.
#' @param t  is all the time steps to be segmented.
#' @param utim  is a a vector of UNIX time points corresponding to 't'. 
#' @param valid  is indices of the valid region of the sonar volume.
#' @param subset  is the subset related to excusion of vessel realted noise such as wake.
#' @param dimvbsc  are the dimenstions of the acoustic data.
#' @param segfilesdir  is the directory of the segmentation files to be written.
#' @param sfnr  is the segmentatino file number.
#' @param dBan  is the dB above background.
#' @param dBb1, dBb2, dBb3, dBb4, dBbs  are the dB belov the signal, where the first four are parameters in the function f(S, SBR, Sv) with dBb1 being the constant term.
#' @param Xsbg, Xsb1  are vectors of the smoothed background estimate (noise is the median over consecutive pings and Gaussian kernel smoothed along beams, whereas Xsb1 is not).
#' @param thisthr  is a vector of the above background-thresholds.
#' @param thersholdFromSchool  is the (unbiased) threshold values defined from the singal.
#' @param Xcsz  is the circular size of the schools, calucated as 2*sqrt(A/pi).
#' @param save.trh  is TRUE to save the threshold values used in the segmentation.
#' @param save.data  is TRUE to save the data included in the segmentation mask.
#' @param kern  is the standard deviation in units of the number of voxels used in a Gaussian kernel smoother along the beams (no smoothing if kern == 0 or length(kern) == 0, which is the default). If given as an integer, say 5L, median smoothing is applied instead of Gaussian.
#' @param wt  is the number of time steps used as the width of the median filter along time steps.
#' @param type  is the function to use across beams (one of "mean" and "median", where "mean" is used in PROFUS up to 2014, while "median" is more robust to the valus of the school).
#' @param cmpred  is a three column matrix holding the centers of mass of the ellipsoid outside which no samples are discarded from the segmentation mask. This matrix must have one row per time step, starting at the first time step.
#' @param ellipsoid  is an optional vector of up to three elements specifying the semi axes of an ellipsoid centered at the center of mass of a user selected region, outside which voxels will not be included in the segmentation. The ellispoid can be set to move with the center of mass of the segmented voxels.
#' @param file_thist_seq  is the time index in the block. If this is equal to 'thist_seq', a new file will be written. Otherwise data will be appended to the file with name given by 'file_thist_seq'.
#' @param reserve  is used in write.TSD() to reserve time steps for the whole block of time steps.
